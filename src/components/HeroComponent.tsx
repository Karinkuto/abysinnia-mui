          In an era where commercial banking services were in an inchoate stage
          and striding towards transforming different sectors of the economy,
          Bank of Abyssiniaâ€™s founders believed in the need for a bank that
          gives comprehensive commercial banking services. Thus, the Bank of
          Abyssinia (BoA) was open for business in 1996 with enthused initiation
          and determination.
